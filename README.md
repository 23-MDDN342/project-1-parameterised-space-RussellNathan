### 2023 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space
## [Iterative Sketch](https://github.com/23-MDDN342/project-1-parameterised-space-RussellNathan/commit/d91de8c391109a3b9363b3e4cfca5be6c31ca274)
The sketch for my background is inspired by the window ghost trails and other graphical glitches you used to see in old operating systems.
My initial idea for the aesthetic is distinctly vaporwave and I aim to incorporate lots of glitches and work towards a glowy old LCD feel. However, at the moment, while I am just testing things, the animation has cute pastel visuals that also work surprisingly well.
While I may not have one clear stylistic vision yet, what I do know is that whatever it is will incorporate glitches, text, retro computer UI and an overall nostalgic feeling.
## [Scalability](https://github.com/23-MDDN342/project-1-parameterised-space-RussellNathan/commit/a57ca8946754bdd65ba25dd5708767341f499681)
My next task was to parameterize all of the variables so that the whole animation can be scaled up uniformly to the large and extra-large dimensions. Everything from the size of the elements to the stroke size has to match perfectly, so just every variable is now affected by the width and height variables. On top of that, I fixed the text in the window to appear as I had initially planned. The text scrolls down one line at a time, once every four frames. I achieved this by checking if the current frame was a multiple of 4/24 using the modulo function and then taking the first line in the text and putting it at the end if it is. There are only 6 (=24/4) lines, so the text seems to scroll in an infinite loop.
## [Design consideration](https://github.com/23-MDDN342/project-1-parameterised-space-RussellNathan/commit/90c23abd5c8c289d8bc2e223efd83a7c75122650)
When I first dropped in the mouse cursor and window animations, I chucked some arbitrary values into the equations affecting the dimensions of the movement ranges until it looked about like what I had in mind. This was good to get the code running, but I have put more thought into the composition of my design and moved things appropriately. Thought has also gone into the colour palette.
## [Final](https://github.com/23-MDDN342/project-1-parameterised-space-RussellNathan/)
I feel like there are some design choices I made that I must justify. Yes, the final design still uses comic sans. It is a fun little font and despite its hand-drawn appearance, it has developed more of a technological association with it, partly due to its use in internet memes. It matches the bright digital-style aesthetic I went for. This project is, after all, intended to be a zoom background. This is also why I abandoned the typical vapor-wave tropes of heavily saturated, high-contrast blues, reds and pinks, instead opting for a more playful pastel base. I still lay the LCD screen texture over it, so the animation wouldn't feel too detached from the digital stylings we are familiar with already. More prominent than the pastel colours though in regards to this detachment, are the smiley faces that appear like stamps over the screen. If this were to appear on a real computer, a user would immediately assume it was some sort of virus. This then lends itself to the theme of the animation, which is computer glitches as well as fitting with the playful aesthetic.
These two things, the computer glitches theme and the playful fun aesthetic, were the biggest things I wanted to empathize with, knowing that I was creating an animation intended to appear as a zoom background. Something that would brighten the mood of a boring Zoom meeting, whilst fitting the context in a clear unique thematic way. There are, however, some things I regret. The animation is quite fast, which might be too distracting. I found that if I turned the scale of the motion down, and the scale of the objects up, I could minimize the apparent motion. Adding a single buffer frame in between each frame also really helped and the motion felt fitting with both the ghosting and the LCD aesthetic as if the image is burning into the screen. Even still, the image just feels a bit too flashy no matter how hard I tried to minimize it. This simply is just what's to be expected given the one-second duration and perhaps it would actually be quite fitting for a user who enjoys being the center of attention.
