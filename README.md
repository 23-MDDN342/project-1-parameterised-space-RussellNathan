### 2023 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space
## Iterative Sketch
The sketch for my background is inspired by the window ghost trails and other graphical glitches you used to see in old operating systems.
My initial idea for the aesthetic is distinctly vaporwave and I aim to incorporate lots of glitches and work towards a glowy old LCD feel. However, at the moment, while I am just testing things, the animation has cute pastel visuals that also work surprisingly well.
While I may not have one clear stylistic vision yet, what I do know is that whatever it is will incorporate glitches, text, retro computer UI and an overall nostalgic feeling.
