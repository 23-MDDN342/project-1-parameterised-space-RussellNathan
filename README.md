### 2023 MDDN342 Project 1: Parameterised Space
## Iterative Sketch
The sketch for my background is inspired by the window ghost trails and other graphical glitches you used to see in old operating systems.
My initial idea for the aesthetic is distinctly vaporwave and I aim to incorporate lots of glitches and work towards a glowy old LCD feel. However, at the moment, while I am just testing things, the animation has cute pastel visuals that also work surprisingly well.
While I may not have one clear stylistic vision yet, what I do know is that whatever it is will incorporate glitches, text, retro computer UI and an overall nostalgic feeling.
## Scalability
My next task was to parameterize all of the variables so that the whole animation can be scaled up uniformly to the large and extra-large dimensions. Everything from the size of the elements to the stroke size has to match perfectly, so just every variable is now affected by the width and height variables. On top of that, I fixed the text in the window to appear as I had initially planned. The text scrolls down one line at a time, once every four frames. I achieved this by checking if the current frame was a multiple of 4/24 using the modulo function and then taking the first line in the text and putting it at the end if it is. There are only 6 (=24/4) lines, so the text seems to scroll in an infinite loop.
## Design consideration
When I first dropped in the mouse cursor and window animations, I chucked some arbitrary values into the equations affecting the dimensions of the movement ranges until it looked about like what I had in mind. This was good to get the code running, but I have put more thought into the composition of my design and moved things appropriately. Thought has also gone into the colour pallete.
